# Background
This project is the culmination of my SQL learning journey with Luke Barousse, an exceptional educator who provided the data and guidance necessary to bring this project to life. 
I highly recommend exploring his work [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mz73uXD9DA&t=3224s). His instructional content is freely accessible on YouTube, making it an invaluable resource for anyone looking to learn SQL. 
## The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:
1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demanded for data nalaysts?
4. What skills are most in demand for data analysts who wants to work remotely and the expected average salary?
# Tools used
For my deep dive into the data analyst job market, I harnessed the power of several key tools:
- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.
- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# Analysis
### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles, I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and location, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.
```sql
SELECT 
    job_id, 
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    company_dim.name AS company_name
FROM 
    job_postings_fact INNER JOIN company_dim ON job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE 
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL AND
    job_location = 'Anywhere' AND 
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
